Projects Brief: "Tic-Tac-Toe" and "Connect4" games using Game Theory

Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game on a 3x3 grid where the goal is to align three "X"s or "O"s in a row. This project uses game theory, specifically the Minimax algorithm and Zero-Sum principles:

Minimax Algorithm: Evaluates all possible moves to choose the optimal one by considering both players' best strategies.
Zero-Sum Game: Each player's gain is the other's loss, emphasizing strategic moves to maximize winning chances while minimizing the opponent's opportunities.

Connect4
Connect4 is a two-player game on a vertical 7x6 grid, aiming to connect four discs in a row. This project also employs game theory, the Minimax algorithm, and Zero-Sum concepts:

Minimax Algorithm: Simulates potential moves to select the best one by evaluating the game tree.

Zero-Sum Game: Strategies focus on maximizing one's advantage while reducing the opponent's chances, making each move critical.

Summary
Both projects utilize game theory techniques, including the Minimax algorithm and Zero-Sum game principles, to create intelligent game-playing agents for Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4, providing a challenging and strategic gameplay experience.
